# Google Document AI to Bitwarden Export

This application streamlines the process of exporting structured data from Google Document AI and formatting it for import into Bitwarden as an identity item.

## Overview

The primary function of this tool is to automate the transfer of personal identification data from a document processed by Google Document AI to a Bitwarden vault. It achieves this by:

1.  Processing a document (e.g., a driver's license or Medicare card) using a specialized Google Document AI processor.
2.  Exporting the extracted entities (such as name, date of birth, license number) into a structured `export.json` file.
3.  Mapping the data from `export.json` to the fields in the `bitwarden_id_template.json` file.
4.  Generating a populated JSON file that can be imported into Bitwarden.

## Files

-   `bitwarden_id_template.json`: A template file representing a Bitwarden identity item. This file contains the structure and fields that Bitwarden expects for an identity, with empty values that will be populated by the application.
-   `export.json`: This file is the output from the Google Document AI processor. It contains the key-value pairs of the data extracted from the source document. This file is generated by the application and is then used as the input for populating the Bitwarden template.

## Workflow

1.  **Data Extraction**: The application sends a document to the Google Document AI API for processing. The API extracts relevant information based on the trained model.
2.  **Generate `export.json`**: The extracted data is then saved locally as `export.json`.
3.  **Populate Template**: The application reads the `export.json` file and the `bitwarden_id_template.json` file. It then maps the values from the export file to the corresponding fields in the template.
4.  **Bitwarden Import File**: The populated template is saved as a new JSON file (e.g., `import_bitwarden.json`), which is ready to be imported into your Bitwarden vault.
